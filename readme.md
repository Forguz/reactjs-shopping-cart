# What is this application?
Its a shoe's store using ReactJS and React Hooks. The reason I've created this application is for training purposes and because is nice to have functionally appications in my github so I can use it as a base for my freelancing projects.

### Requirements to run the application in your machine:
- [NodeJS and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/ "NodeJS and NPM") installed with the proper dependencies.

### How to run
You need to install the modules by running the following command in your command line:
`npm install`

After the installation you'll have to run the json-server:
`npm run server`

Then you just need to type and run the next command:
`npm run start`
